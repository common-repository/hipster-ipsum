Use Hipster Ipsum as a filler text. Shortcode is [hipster]. It's far less mainstream than Lorem Ipsum.

== Description ==

Instead of Lorem Ipsum, we have Hipster Ipsum. Uses hipster type vocabulary as filler text. Creates a shortcode that has the ability to create a variable number of paragraphs. Uses curl and the API at hipsterjesus.com to get the text.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hipster.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `[hipster]` shortcode in your posts and pages to create filler text.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the number of paragraphs? =

Change the PBR attribute in the shortcode. For example, if you wanted 10 paragraphs, use [hipster pbr="10"]. If you wanted 1 paragraph, use [hipster pbr="1"].

= What is the default number of paragraphs. =

The default is 4.

== Screenshots ==

* Random stuff
= 1.0 =
* All of the Hipster-y, vintage, PBR goodness is complete.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Nothing so far. Upgrades are too mainstream, anyway.
